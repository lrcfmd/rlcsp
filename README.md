# Reinforcement Learning for Crystal Structure Prediction

Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) plays a crucial role in computational chemistry and materials design, being a powerful tool for the discovery of new materials with desirable properties. As the immense number of potential element combinations and their spatial arrangements present a significant challenge, approaches are being developed to explore the potential energy surface, generating trial structures and identifying those with the lowest energy. The efficiency of a crystal structure prediction algorithm is largely dependent on the decision-making process used to generate trial structures for further local optimization. There are various ways to approach the problem, ranging from generating structures randomly through brute force, to making various modifications to the already generated structures, or using a combination of both methods.

Every CSP code has its own algorithm and parameterisation, which is characterised by the implemented decision-making process or policy used to generate trial structures. If the policy is stochastic it raises the question of how to distribute probabilities for different types of structure modification. This package allows the dynamic generation of an adaptive stochastic policy aimed to increase the chances to get the structure with lower energy. The policy does not require pre-training and is learned on-the-fly via the REINFORCE algorithm, the classical Reinforcement Learning algorithm.

This package is used in [FUSE][fuse] and [MC-EMMA][mcemma] for the policy optimization and can be embedded into other CSP code.

## Installation

This has been tested on unix based systems.

Requirements:

1) Python3.6 or later

once you have python3 installed, you need to download the following 
dependencies all of which can be installed via pip:

1) numpy
2) math
3) statistics
4) matplotlib
5) time
6) random
7) mysql
8) mysql-connector-python-rf (this will install mysql in python as well)
9) scipy
10) heapq

You can then install RLCSP by typing:

python3 setup.py install

################################################################################

In order to run RLCSP, you will require to have access to a MySQL server.
You can install a MySQL server on local machine using this guide:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/#mysql-getting-started-installing
NOTE: you will need to set a password for the root user when installing mysql.

################################################################################

To run on a local machine, once mysql is installed as above you will need to set up a 
local user for your install of mysql, using the root user account created when mysql
was installed. From a command terminal type the following:

sudo mysql -u root -p

You will need to enter the sudo password for your machine and then the roos password
setup when mysql was installed. Then enter the following

CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'mypassword';

Where ‘myuser’ should be replaced with the username that you want to use run the rl-csp 
codes, and ‘mypassword’ is your chosen password for the database.


## Usage

To use RLCSP in FUSE or MC-EMMA you need first to download and install FUSE (https://github.com/lrcfmd/FUSE_RL)
or MC-EMMA (https://github.com/lrcfmd/MC-EMMA-RL). Then fill in fields 'host', 'database', 'user', 'password' 
to access your MySQL Server in the chosen input file. Then you can run the input file. 

################################################################################

The input files for each policy-composition pair tested in the paper "Reinforcement Learning in Crystal Structure Prediction" are located in the folders 'input_FUSE' and 'input_MCEMMA' and can be used to reproduce the results of the paper. The input files are named as 'input_\<CODE\>\_\<policy\>\_\<composition\>.py' where \<CODE\> is either FUSE or MCEMMA, \<policy\> is one of three policies (RLCSP, Original, Uniform), and \<composition\> is one of six compositions (Sr4Ti3O10, Y2TiO5, Y2Ti2O7, Sr2YO4, Y2O3, YBa2Ca2Fe5O13). 
To run FUSE with the Original or Uniform policies you need to install the corresponding version of FUSE (https://github.com/lrcfmd/FUSE-stable); please, use FUSE 1.04 (folder '104') for the Original policy or FUSE 1.06 (folder '106') for the Uniform policy.
To run MC-EMMA with the Original or Uniform policies you need to install MC-EMMA from https://github.com/lrcfmd/MC-EMMA-stable .

Removing mysql databases that you are finished with

If you wish to remove databases from your machine, you can login to mysql from the command line:

mysql -u 'myuser' -p

and then use the following command to remove a database as set with "database" above:

DROP DATABASE "database";
